# Disability navigator - An Application for Geotagging of Disabled-Friendly Locations  

## Overview  
I created the **Geotagging of Disabled-Friendly Locations** project as an **Android application** to help make the world more accessible for people with disabilities. Whether someone is deaf, mute, blind, or physically handicapped, this app provides a crowdsourced platform to find and share locations that cater to their needs. Itâ€™s my way of using technology to bridge the gap in accessibility and empower individuals to navigate their communities with confidence.  

## Why I Built This  
Accessibility is something Iâ€™m deeply passionate about. I realized that while millions of people face daily challenges due to inaccessible spaces, thereâ€™s no centralized, reliable way to find information about disabled-friendly locations. This project is my attempt to solve that problem.  

Hereâ€™s what motivated me:  

1. **Empowering People with Disabilities**  
   - I wanted to create a tool that helps people **discover and share** accessible locations, from wheelchair ramps to braille signages.  
   - The app is designed to help users **plan their journeys** with confidence, knowing theyâ€™ll have access to the amenities they need.  

2. **Community-Driven Solutions**  
   - The app relies on **user contributions** to build and maintain its database. Every geotag, photo, or review helps make the map more accurate and up-to-date.  
   - I believe that the best solutions come from the people who use them, so I designed this app to be **community-powered**.  

3. **Assistive Technology for Inclusivity**  
   - I integrated features like **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and **voice navigation** to make the app usable for people with different disabilities.  
   - The interface is designed to be **intuitive and adaptable**, ensuring it works for everyone.  

4. **Raising Awareness**  
   - Beyond the app, I hope to spark conversations about accessibility and inspire businesses and governments to **improve infrastructure**.  
   - The data collected through the app could also help policymakers and organizations make cities more inclusive.  

## Features  
Hereâ€™s what the app can do:

ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time Navigation** â€“ Using the **Google Maps API**, users can get directions to accessible locations in real time.  
ðŸ”¹ **Offline Access** â€“ The app uses **SQLite** to store data locally, so users can access information even without an internet connection.  
ðŸ”¹ **Community-Driven** â€“ Users can upvote, comment, and validate locations to keep the data accurate and reliable.  
ðŸ”¹ **Cloud Sync** â€“ All data is stored and synced using **Firebase Firestore**, so updates are seamless across devices.  

## Tech Stack
