# Geotagging of Disabled-Friendly Locations  

## Overview  
I created the **Geotagging of Disabled-Friendly Locations** project as an **Android application** to help make the world more accessible for people with disabilities. Whether someone is deaf, mute, blind, or physically handicapped, this app provides a crowdsourced platform to find and share locations that cater to their needs. It’s my way of using technology to bridge the gap in accessibility and empower individuals to navigate their communities with confidence.  

## Why I Built This  
Accessibility is something I’m deeply passionate about. I realized that while millions of people face daily challenges due to inaccessible spaces, there’s no centralized, reliable way to find information about disabled-friendly locations. This project is my attempt to solve that problem.  

Here’s what motivated me:  

1. **Empowering People with Disabilities**  
   - I wanted to create a tool that helps people **discover and share** accessible locations, from wheelchair ramps to braille signages.  
   - The app is designed to help users **plan their journeys** with confidence, knowing they’ll have access to the amenities they need.  

2. **Community-Driven Solutions**  
   - The app relies on **user contributions** to build and maintain its database. Every geotag, photo, or review helps make the map more accurate and up-to-date.  
   - I believe that the best solutions come from the people who use them, so I designed this app to be **community-powered**.  

3. **Assistive Technology for Inclusivity**  
   - I integrated features like **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and **voice navigation** to make the app usable for people with different disabilities.  
   - The interface is designed to be **intuitive and adaptable**, ensuring it works for everyone.  

4. **Raising Awareness**  
   - Beyond the app, I hope to spark conversations about accessibility and inspire businesses and governments to **improve infrastructure**.  
   - The data collected through the app could also help policymakers and organizations make cities more inclusive.  

## Features  
Here’s what the app can do:  

🔹 **Crowdsourced Geotagging** – Users can add, edit, and review disabled-friendly locations, complete with photos and descriptions.  
🔹 **Smart Categorization** – Locations are tagged with accessibility features like wheelchair ramps, braille signs, or hearing loop systems.  
🔹 **Voice & Speech Features** – The app supports **voice commands, text-to-speech, and speech recognition** to make navigation easier for everyone.  
🔹 **Real-Time Navigation** – Using the **Google Maps API**, users can get directions to accessible locations in real time.  
🔹 **Offline Access** – The app uses **SQLite** to store data locally, so users can access information even without an internet connection.  
🔹 **Community-Driven** – Users can upvote, comment, and validate locations to keep the data accurate and reliable.  
🔹 **Cloud Sync** – All data is stored and synced using **Firebase Firestore**, so updates are seamless across devices.  

## Tech Stack  
Here’s what I used to build the app:  
- **Android Development:** Java, XML, Android Studio  
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore, SQLite  
- **APIs:** Google Maps API, Google Places API, Speech-to-Text API  
- **Assistive Features:** Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech Recognition, Voice Commands
